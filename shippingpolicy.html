    <p>Last updated: November 5, 2025</p>

    <p>
      At <strong>SP Enterprises</strong>, we specialize in providing financial products and services, and we do not deal in the physical shipment of goods. However, for the purpose of digital documentation, statements, or any related material, our shipping policy outlines how we handle electronic and, where applicable, physical deliveries.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#0A3D62;">1. Digital Deliverables</h2>
    <p>
      All our services are primarily digital in nature. Loan account statements, receipts, transaction records, and payment confirmations are delivered electronically to the customer’s registered email address or made available through our official online platform or mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#0A3D62;">2. Delivery Timelines</h2>
    <p>
      Once a transaction or payment is successfully completed, digital documents such as payment receipts or loan schedules are usually delivered instantly or within <strong>24 to 48 business hours</strong>. If there is any delay due to technical or network issues, customers will be notified accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#0A3D62;">3. Physical Deliveries (If Applicable)</h2>
    <p>
      In rare cases where physical documentation or correspondence is required, such as signed agreements or verification documents, we may dispatch them via registered courier services or India Post. Delivery timelines in such cases may vary between <strong>5 to 10 business days</strong> depending on the customer’s location.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#0A3D62;">4. Tracking and Confirmation</h2>
    <p>
      Customers will receive tracking details or confirmation messages for any dispatch initiated by <strong>SP Enterprises</strong>. For digital deliveries, confirmation emails serve as proof of successful delivery.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#0A3D62;">5. Incorrect Email or Address</h2>
    <p>
      It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that their registered email address and postal address are accurate and up to date. <strong>SP Enterprises</strong> will not be held responsible for delays or non-delivery caused by incorrect or outdated contact information.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#0A3D62;">6. Non-Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      In the event that you do not receive your digital documents within the expected timeframe, please contact our customer support through the official channels mentioned on our website. We will reissue or resend the documents upon verification of your transaction details.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#0A3D62;">7. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>SP Enterprises</strong> shall not be held liable for delays or failures in delivery caused by circumstances beyond our control, including natural disasters, government restrictions, network outages, or other unforeseen events.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#0A3D62;">8. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
      This shipping policy is subject to periodic review and may be updated at any time to align with operational or regulatory changes. The latest version will always be available on our official website.
